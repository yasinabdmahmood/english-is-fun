<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 English is fun <a name="about-project"></a>

> **English is fun** is a web application designed to help English language learners improve their vocabulary and descriptive skills. The app provides users with a random word generated by OpenAI's API endpoint, which the user must then describe in their own words using the input field provided. To cater to the user's level of proficiency, **English is fun** and allows the user to choose the difficulty level of the word, ranging from A1 (easiest) to C2 (most advanced). Once the user submits their description, the app makes an API call to OpenAI's API endpoint to evaluate the accuracy and quality of the description. The evaluation is then displayed to the user as feedback, with a score on a scale of 1 to 10. **English is fun** easy to use and accessible to learners of all levels. Whether you're just starting or looking to improve your existing skills, **English is fun** and is a great tool for anyone looking to improve their English language proficiency. So why wait? Start practicing your English skills today **English is fun**!
